# Whitehall Examples Restructure Plan

## Problem Statement

Current state has 19 examples with significant redundancy and overlap. Many examples teach the same concepts repeatedly without clear progression from simple to complex. Critical advanced features (FFI) are missing entirely.

## Current State Analysis (19 examples)

### Redundant/Overlapping Examples

1. **Examples 2 (task-list) + 14 (todo-app)**
   - Both are todo lists with CRUD operations
   - 2 is single-file, 14 is multi-file with components
   - **Action:** Merge into one comprehensive todo example

2. **Examples 3 (user-profile) + 17 (profile-settings)**
   - 3 shows profile display (read-only)
   - 17 shows profile editing (read-write)
   - **Action:** Merge into one profile editor example

3. **Examples 4 (form-validation) + 11 (complex-forms)**
   - Both teach form validation patterns
   - 11 is more complex but teaches same concepts
   - **Action:** Keep 11 (complex-forms), delete 4

4. **Examples 7 (dialogs-snackbars) + 13 (bottom-sheet)**
   - Both demonstrate modal/overlay patterns
   - **Action:** Merge into comprehensive modals example

5. **Examples 12 (search-filter) + 19 (notes-app)**
   - 12 focuses on filtering products
   - 19 has filtering + CRUD + categories
   - **Action:** Keep 19 (more comprehensive), delete 12

### Nice-to-have but Not Core Progression

- **Example 8 (animations)** - Not essential for learning core patterns
- **Example 9 (theming)** - Not essential for learning core patterns
- **Action:** Delete both, can be covered in docs

### Missing Critical Concepts

- ❌ **No FFI examples** (Rust/C++) - This is a key differentiator!
- ❌ **No clear ViewModel/Store patterns** - State management unclear
- ❌ **No real multi-screen navigation** - Example 5 exists but could be better
- ⚠️ **Async patterns underrepresented** - Only example 6

## Proposed Structure (14 examples)

### **Tier 1: Fundamentals (1-5)**
*Core concepts needed for any Whitehall app*

1. **counter** - Hello world, basic reactive state
   - **Keep:** Example 1 (button-counter)
   - Teaches: var state, onClick, reactive updates

2. **todo-list** - Lists, CRUD operations, components
   - **Merge:** Examples 2 + 14 → Keep 14's multi-file structure
   - Teaches: List management, add/delete, components, LazyColumn
   - File structure: `components/TodoItem.wh`, `main.wh`

3. **forms-validation** - Input handling, validation patterns
   - **Merge:** Examples 4 + 11 → Keep 11's structure, improve naming
   - Teaches: TextField, validation logic, error states, form submission
   - File structure: `components/ValidationTextField.wh`, `stores/RegistrationForm.wh`

4. **profile-editor** - Complex forms with state management
   - **Merge:** Examples 3 + 17 → Combine display + editing
   - Teaches: Form state, save/cancel, multi-field forms
   - File structure: `components/ProfileField.wh`, `main.wh`

5. **async-data** - Async operations, loading states
   - **Keep:** Example 6 (already well-structured)
   - Teaches: suspend functions, loading/error states, retry logic
   - File structure: `stores/PostStore.wh`, `components/{PostCard,PostListView}.wh`

### **Tier 2: UI Patterns (6-9)**
*Common UI patterns and layouts*

6. **navigation** - Multi-screen navigation
   - **Improve:** Example 5 or create better navigation example
   - Teaches: Screen navigation, back stack, passing data
   - Target: 2-3 screens with navigation between them

7. **tabs-layouts** - TabRow, complex layouts
   - **Keep:** Example 10 (tabs-navigation)
   - Teaches: TabRow, switching content, state per tab

8. **modals-dialogs** - Dialog, AlertDialog, modal patterns
   - **Merge:** Examples 7 + 13 → Comprehensive modals
   - Teaches: AlertDialog, dismiss patterns, modal state
   - Show: Info dialog, form dialog, confirmation dialog

9. **search-filter** - Filtering, sorting, search
   - **Keep:** Example 12 (search-filter)
   - Teaches: Filtering lists, search input, category filters
   - File structure: `stores/CatalogStore.wh`, `components/ItemCard.wh`

### **Tier 3: Complete Apps (10-12)**
*Full applications demonstrating multiple concepts together*

10. **weather-dashboard** - Multi-component app with async data
    - **Keep:** Example 15
    - Demonstrates: Multiple components, async loading, list display
    - File structure: `components/{WeatherCard,ForecastItem}.wh`

11. **notes-app** - Full CRUD with categories and filtering
    - **Keep:** Example 19
    - Demonstrates: Complete CRUD, categories, filtering, state management

12. **calculator** - State machine, operation handling
    - **Keep:** Example 18
    - Demonstrates: State machine patterns, operation sequencing
    - File structure: `components/CalcButton.wh`

### **Tier 4: Advanced - FFI (13-14)**
*High-performance native code integration*

13. **rust-ffi-image-filters** - Rust FFI for image processing
    - **Create new:** Example 20 (work in progress)
    - Demonstrates: Rust FFI, high-performance computations
    - File structure:
      - `src/ffi/rust/src/lib.rs` - Rust functions with #[ffi]
      - `src/ffi/rust/src/jni_bridge.rs` - Auto-generated JNI
      - `src/components/ColorPreview.wh`
      - `whitehall.toml` with `[ffi]` config
    - Functions: rgb_to_grayscale, adjust_brightness, invert_color, sepia filters

14. **cpp-ffi-string-utils** - C++ FFI for text processing

   - Delete old `4-form-validation`

4. **7 + 13 → 7 (modals-dialogs)**
   - Combine dialog types from both
   - Keep structure from 7
   - Add bottom sheet example
   - Delete `13-bottom-sheet`

### Examples to Renumber (After deletions/merges)

## Success Criteria

✅ **Clear progression**: Simple (1-5) → Patterns (6-9) → Apps (10-12) → Advanced (13-14)
✅ **No redundancy**: Each example teaches distinct concepts
✅ **FFI coverage**: Both Rust and C++ examples included
✅ **Practical focus**: Every example serves learning progression
✅ **14 focused examples** instead of 19 scattered ones

## Migration Notes

### For existing users
- Old example numbers will change
- Document mapping: old → new example numbers
- Provide migration guide for tutorials/docs referencing old numbers

### Breaking changes
- Examples 4, 8, 9, 12, 13 removed
- Examples 14, 17 merged into earlier numbers
- Example numbers 6-19 renumbered to 5-14

## FFI Requirements Documentation

### Prerequisites for FFI examples
- **Rust FFI**: Requires Rust toolchain, Android NDK
- **C++ FFI**: Requires Android NDK, CMake
- **Build time**: FFI examples take longer to build (native compilation)
- **Size**: NDK download is ~1GB

### Alternative for learning
- FFI examples include complete source code
- Can be studied without building (for learning the pattern)
- Build instructions provided for those who want to run them
- Consider: "FFI-lite" examples without actual native code?

## Open Questions

1. **Should we keep example 16 (settings-app)?**
   - Pro: Good UI pattern example
   - Con: Doesn't teach new concepts beyond forms
   - **Decision:** TBD

2. **Navigation example - improve 5 or create new?**
   - Current example 5 exists but might need work
   - **Decision:** Evaluate and improve or replace

3. **FFI build requirements - too heavy?**
   - Requires NDK, Rust toolchain
   - **Decision:** Provide source code, make build optional

4. **Single-file vs multi-file?**
   - Examples 1-5: Mix (1 is single-file, rest multi-file?)
   - Examples 6+: All multi-file to show structure
   - **Decision:** TBD based on teaching value

## Timeline

- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 hours (delete, merge)
- **Phase 3**: 30 min (renumber)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 hours (FFI examples)
- **Phase 5**: 1 hour (documentation)

**Total estimated effort**: 5-7 hours
